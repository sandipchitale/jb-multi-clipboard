# Paste From System Clipboard History

- Use new **Cycle Paste from System Clipboard History** action repeatedly within one second to paste next item in the system clipboard history. Of course this makes sense only if you bind the action to some `keyboard shortcut`.
- Paste from System Clipboard Action
- System Clipboard History tool window to manage the history.
  - Allow deletion by row

**IMPORTANT NOTE: Listens to the changes in system clipboard.**

Cleanup.
